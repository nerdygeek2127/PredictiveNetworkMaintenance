# PredictiveNetworkMaintenance

**PredictiveNetworkMaintenance** is a machine learning-based system designed to predict maintenance needs for network infrastructure. Using historical performance data, the system trains a model to identify potential issues proactively, enhancing operational efficiency and reducing downtime.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gathers and preprocesses historical network performance data.
- **Condition-Based Labeling**: Automatically labels data points indicating the need for maintenance based on predefined conditions.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes a RandomForestClassifier to train the model on labeled data.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using accuracy metrics.
- **Predictions**: Applies the trained model to new data to predict maintenance needs.
- **Output**: Saves the processed data with maintenance predictions to an Excel file.

## How to Use

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure your network performance data is in an Excel file with the required columns.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the provided Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and generate maintenance predictions.
3. **Review Predictions**: Check the output Excel file to review the predicted maintenance needs for each data point.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PredictiveNetworkMaintenance.git
   cd PredictiveNetworkMaintenance
   \`\`\`

2. Install the required Python packages:
   \`\`\`sh
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn openpyxl
   \`\`\`

## Usage

1. Place your network performance data Excel file in the repository directory.
2. Update the `file_path` variable in the script to point to your data file.
3. Run the script:
   \`\`\`sh
   python ml.py
   \`\`\`
4. The script will generate an output Excel file with the maintenance predictions.
